<!--(modeltable)-->
  (ref:modeltable-cap) Random and fixed effect model structures (a) The four random effect models with their corresponding formulas. (b) The five fixed effect models with their corresponding formulas. Choice represents the binary dependent variable of larger or smaller item chosen by the subject.   

```{r modeltable, fig.show="hold", out.width="100%",  fig.align="center", fig.cap = "(ref:modeltable-cap)"}

```


<!--(bftable)-->
  (ref:bftable-cap) Bayes factor, BIC, and AIC values per model (a) Random effect models and Bayes factor, BIC, and AIC values for the food study (b) Fixed effect models and Bayes factor, BIC, and AIC values for the food study (c) Random effect models and Bayes factor, BIC, and AIC values for the social study. (d) Fixed effect models and Bayes factor, BIC, and AIC values for the social study. Reminder: _BF_ > 3 show moderate evidence for the alternative hypothesis while _BF_ < 0.33 show moderate evidence for the null hypothesis. A _BF_ in between 3 and 0.33 is inconclusive.

<!--(paristable)-->
  (ref:pairstable-cap) Factorial pair combinations used each experiment. We used every factorial pair from 1 to 6 resulting in 15 combinations. The second and third columns show the ratio and difference for each pair, respectively. 

```{r pairstable, fig.show="hold", out.width="70%", fig.align="center", fig.cap = "(ref:pairstable-cap)"}
