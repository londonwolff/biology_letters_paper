Abstract

The ability to discriminate between different quantities has important ecological relevance for animals when engaging in behaviours such as forming groups, foraging or trying to avoid predators. Quantity discrimination has been shown in a diversity of human and nonhuman animal species. In angelfish this discrimination ability has been investigated using dichotomous choice tests when the numerically different stimulus groups (shoals) of conspecifics were fully visible to the test fish. Here, using a new procedure we investigated whether test fish were able to discriminate between the contrasting shoals using their memory. After a period of full visual access to the contrasted shoals on the two sides of their test tank, the test fish was required to make a choice while being able to see only a single member of the stimulus shoals on each side. With this cognitively more demanding procedure we tested discrimination between numerically large shoals (≥ four fish per stimulus shoal). As in our previous studies, we found that angelfish consistently chose the larger of the two shoals when the shoals differed by a 2:1 or higher ratio, but not those that differed by a 3:2 or 4:3 ratio. The results followed Weber's law in that performance became poorer as the ratio between the two stimulus shoals approached one. In addition, when we kept the absolute difference between the contrasted shoals constant, discrimination was less accurate as the shoal sizes increased. This pattern of results lends support for the analogue magnitude representational system in the angelfish, a nonverbal approximation system believed to be employed by a diversity of human and nonhuman animal species. Furthermore, our results also demonstrate that angelfish remember the different shoals presented to them, i.e. they make their choice based upon mental representation of the different quantities.
