Abstract

Two pigeons learned to respond to 4 objects while withholding response to 2 objects. The birds maintained their numerical discrimination when new objects were introduced. They also maintained the discrimination when large and small objects were used to construct '2" and '4," and when different kinds of objects were mixed to make '2" and '4."' The Ss responded most often to 4 objects when tested with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 objects in the generalization test after the 4th discrimination task. These results suggest the ability of numerical discrimination in pigeons. Two other birds that were trained to peck 2 objects but not to peck 4 objects showed, however, severe difficulty in learning this task. Thus, pigeons' ability for numerical discrimination is affected by training procedure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)
