ABSTRACT. Spontaneous numerical discrimination has been observed in animals in laboratory and field studies. These studies often rely on subjects choosing the most profitable food items. I designed a feeding apparatus to explore the spontaneous numerical discrimination of a free-living northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos). The feeder consisted of two tubes containing food rewards. In order to attain the reward from a tube, the subject had to remove one or more obstacles. I tested to see if the subject would choose the tube with greatest profitability first. The subject did not discriminate when given a choice between a tube with two obstacles and a tube with three obstacles. The subject also did not discriminate between a tube with larger number of food items and a tube with fewer food items (each tube with one obstacle). However, the subject did discriminate between a tube with reward and a tube without reward. The failure of the subject to discriminate on the basis of number may reflect the low cost associated with making the sub-optimal choice. With some improvements, the feeding apparatus may provide a way to examine spontaneous numerical competence in free-living birds without having to capture subjects.

INTRODUCTION

Recent studies have demonstrated remarkable numerical abilities in trained captive birds (Pepperberg 1999; Brannon and others 2001; Xia and others 2001). An African grey parrot (Psittacus eritbacus) was trained to vocalize the appropriate number label when presented with one to six objects (Pepperberg 1994, 1999). Pigeons (Columba livia) were trained to peck the appropriate key (of two possibilities) in response to the difference between two numerical quantities presented as flashes of light (Brannon and others 2001). Brannon and others (2001) interpreted that as evidence of subtraction and a linear number scale in pigeons (but see Dehaene 2001 for an alternative interpretation). Xia and others (2001) trained pigeons to associate visual symbols with numerical quantities from one to five. Those studies and others clearly demonstrated numerical competence in birds in laboratory situations. However, such studies do not allow inferences about numerical competence in wild animals.

Untrained animals can be presented with choice experiments that exploit the tendency of wild animals to make decisions on the basis of optimal foraging theory (Stephens and Krebs 1986). According to that theory, a foraging animal should choose the option that maximizes profitability (the net rate of caloric intake). The optimal choice may be the one providing highest caloric value or the one that can be attained within the least amount of time. Using this approach, spontaneous numerical competence in untrained animals has been demonstrated in a few studies. Hauser and others (2000) presented untrained macaques (Macaca mulatta) with a choice of two boxes. Subjects were allowed to witness as researchers placed apple slices into each box. Macaques preferentially approached the box with larger number of apple slices up to a comparison of three slices in one box and five slices in the other.

The objective of the present study was to determine numerical competence in untrained, wild northern mockingbirds...
