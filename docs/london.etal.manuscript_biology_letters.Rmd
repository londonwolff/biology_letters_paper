abstract: >
 Animals must often discriminate different quantities of objects in their environment, from numbers of food items to conspecifics. Yet we know little about how this numerical cognition compares across different types of objects. Based on past research, we would expect individuals to use both numerical ratio and numerical difference to choose between two numerical options. This study investigates whether numerical ratio and difference predict numerical preference in pinyon jays (_Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus_) for two types of stimuli, food items and conspecifics. Subjects (N=12 for food condition, N=20 for social condition) chose between two options using every paired combination of food item or group size number between 1 and 6. Upon completion of all pairs for a given item: food or conspecific the bird particpants were switched to the other item category. Therefore birds saw both item choices in random order.In the food condition, the pinyon jays showed an overall preference for the larger option over the smaller option but not for the social condition. Also for the food condition, pinyon jays preferred numbers of items with higher numerical differences and lower numerical ratios. However, numerical difference did not influence preference independently of ratio. For the social condition, neither difference nor ratio predicted the subjects’ choices. Thus, the pinyon jays showed different effects of numerical difference and ratio on preference across food items and conspecifics. One rationale for these results are pinyon jays use different strategies when deciding between numbers of food items and flock mates. While number is important for selecting food items, other factors such as flock mate identity may be more important for selecting social groups to join. Thus, in numerical preference situations, the type of objects offered drive the numerical strategies that animals use.

# Introduction

Many animal species have demonstrated the ability to quantify objects in their environment, including bees [@Dacke.Srinivasan.2008], fish [@Agrillo.etal.2008; @Agrillo.Dadda.2007;@Agrillo.etal.2011], amphibians [@Uller.etal.2003], birds [@Xia.etal.2001;@Emmerton.Renner.2006;@Emmerton.Renner.2009], and mammals [@Vonk.Beran.2012] but especially primates [@Nieder.2018;@Call.2000;@Beran.2001]. As these animals are not closely related phylogenetically, some diverging hundreds of millions of years apart from each other [@Nieder.2018], quantification skills must have strong adaptive value. These adaptive benefits can be broken down into two main subgroups: benefits for survival and reproduction. Survival benefits include but are not limited to navigation, predator avoiding, territory defense, and cooperative hunting/foraging [@Nieder.2020;@Agrillo.etal.2017;@Yang.Chiao.2016]. For example, wolves are more likely to capture a buffalo, if they cooperatively hunt in groups of 9-13 [@MacNulty.etal.2014]. Reproduction benefits of numerical competence include courtship, mating, and avoiding brood parasitism [@White.etal.2009;@Carazo.etal.2012;@Arak.1983]. Having some form of numeric competence must be an important cognitive skill that incurs fitness benefits for survival and reproduction. 

Within the ANS, estimates are approximated through the use of numerical ratios and differences through the _numerical magnitude effect_ and the  _numerical distance effect_ [@Ditz.Nieder.2016;@Dehaene.etal.1998]. A numerical ratio is the mathematical quotient between two numbers: 2/4 has a ratio of 0.5. A numerical difference is the mathematical difference between two numbers: 4-2 has a difference of 2. The _numerical magnitude effect_ asserts that, at a given numerical difference, discrimination worsens with increasing magnitude, which is equivalent to a decreasing numerical ratio. Essentially, it becomes harder to discriminate as the numerical ratio approaches 1. The _numerical distance effect_ asserts that number discrimination improves with increasing numerical difference between two values. Essentially, it becomes easier to discriminate as the options become more dissimilar. Taken together, these two effects describe Weber’s Law [@Nieder.2020]. Quantity discriminations that follow Weber’s law are a clear signature of the internal ANS and data showing difference and ratio effects illustrate the use of approximate amounts rather than precise numbers.

Past animal research investigating numerical cognition has found evidence that number is a relevant stimulus cue to which animals are sensitive across a number of contexts [@Agrillo.Beran.2013;@Agrillo.Bisazza.2014]. Most of these numerical discrimination tasks use food or objects as stimuli [@Call.2000;@Beran.2001;@Kelly.2016;@Scarf.etal.2011;@Rugani.etal.2013]. In previous studies, accuracy decreased as the ratio between the values approached 1, a direct confirmation of the _numerical magnitude effect_ [@Ditz.Nieder.2016;@Cantlon.Brannon.2006; @Merten.Nieder.2009;@Hanus.Call.2007;@Evans.etal.2009]. The second half of Weber’s Law has been confirmed showing animals discriminate between a pair of numbers with more accuracy at larger numerical differences, _numerical distance effect_, [@Ditz.Nieder.2016;@Kelly.2016;@Tornick.etal.2015;@Ditz.Nieder.2015]. However, a subset of studies looking at fish use conspecifics (members of the same species) to assess numerical cognition [@Buckingham.etal.2007;@Agrillo.etal.2008;@Gomez-Laplaza.Gerlai.2016]. Many species prefer to be in larger groups, presumably because this dilutes their probability of being captured by predators [@Krause.Ruxton.2002;@Silk.etal.2014]. Though some studies show an effect of both difference and ratio on social preference [@Agrillo.Dadda.2007;@Agrillo.etal.2008], others only show an effect of ratio [@Buckingham.etal.2007;@Gomez-Laplaza.Gerlai.2011]. In all four of these conspecific item studies, subjects were better at discriminating ratios above one half than below. This is in accordance with the numerical magnitude effect, with only one of the four providing evidence that fish were capable of discriminating ratios below 1:2. Research shows ratio and difference effects in animals across contexts, yet no one has looked at context effects on numerical preference within a single test population of any one species.

## Present Study

The primary aim of the present study was to investigate how pinyon jays use numerical information, specifically numerical difference and ratio, to choose between different quantities of food items or conspecifics. To address this aim, we offered pinyon jays a series of choices between smaller and larger numbers of items: either high calorie treats (mealworms) or conspecifics. Upon the completion of this first experimental phase we then swapped the bird participants from their respective groups into the other. Meaning: the birds that completed phase 1 of experimentation with the food items competed phase 2 with conspecifics and visa versa. This within subject design allowed us to make a stronger argument for species context dependent effects.

To test our research question, we tested three hypotheses. Our first hypothesis (H1) posits that pinyon jays will, on average, prefer larger over smaller numbers of food items and conspecifics. An animal is more likely to survive, increasing their fitness outcome, if they consume more food. Similarity, an animal is more likely to survive by living in larger rather than smaller groups because they are decreasing the chance they will be killed by a predator. We hypothesize that pinyon jays would choose the larger flock as it increases your chances of finding a suitable mate and avoiding predators. Our second hypothesis (H2) posits that pinyon jays will show strong preferences for items with higher numerical differences and lower numerical ratios. As differences and ratios approach 1, the discrimination difficulty decreases. Discriminating between five and six mealworms is more difficult than discrimination between one and six. Our third hypothesis (H3) posits that both numerical difference and ratio will influence preference independently of each other. This distinction is important because difference and ratio are highly correlated with each other: as difference increases, ratio decreases. It is important to understand whether pinyon jays use difference, ratio, or both in a preference task to better understand how corvids make decisions across foraging and social domains.

# Methods

## Subjects

Phase 1: Eight Pinyon Jays (1 female) completed all rounds of the food experiment and 10 Pinyon Jays (4 female) completed all rounds of the social experiment. A further 17 Pinyon Jays (6 female) from the colony were used as stooge conspecifics in the social experiment. Two Pinyon Jays were dropped from the social experiment due to unrelated health concerns.

Phase 2: Four Pinyon Jays (1 female) completed all rounds of the food experiment and 10 Pinyon Jays (1 female) completed all rounds of the social experiment. A further 12 Pinyon Jays (5 female) from the colony were used as stooge conspecifics in the social experiment. 

The Pinyon Jays in the food item experiment were housed two to a double cage, while the jays in the social experiment were individually housed. (electronic supplementary material, appendix ##)

## Food Experiment

### Apparatus 

The apparatus for the food experiment included a bird cage (72 x 48 x 48 cm) abutting a plastic stand with sliding trays that contained mealworms. Subjects started each trial perched on the large free standing perch, and then chose by landing on the smaller left or right perches. They then consumed the mealworms associated with their decision while the unchosen side was removed.

### Experimental Procedure

The subjects were not food restricted and were fed three hours prior to the start of the experiment. The experimenter placed the appropriate number of mealworms in each of the dishes. The subject then started the trial on the back perch and hopped forward to one of the front perches to signal choice. The experimenter then removed the opposite dish and the subject had up to three minutes to consume their mealworms. Once the subject consumed all mealworms, the next trial began. If the subject did not make a choice and/or did not finish all mealworms within 3 minutes this triggered a stop on that days session.

Each bird experienced 10 phases for each of the 15 numerical pairs between 1 and 6 (e.g., 6 vs 5, 6 vs 4, 6 vs 3, etc.). The side of the larger option was pseudo randomized with no left or right runs longer than three in a row. Subjects order was randomized per session.  

## Social Experiment

### Apparatus 

The apparatus took the form of a Y maze formed out of chicken wire, plastic sheets, and Plexiglas. The subject entered a large chamber at the base of the maze before choosing one of two arms of the Y maze. At the entrance to both arms, a guillotine style door was closed after the bird walked or flew past it, thus making a choice between the option on the left or right. At the end of each arm, was a large bird cage housing the stooge birds.

### Experimental Procedure

The subjects were not food restricted. The handler placed the subject inside the apparatus and showed them each option for six seconds before releasing the subject into the chamber. Once the subject crossed the threshold of one of the doors, the recorder closed *both* doors gently but swiftly. After three minutes elapsed, the handler collected the subject and returned them to their home cage. These steps repeated until all birds had run through the experiment.

Each subject experienced 5 trials for each of the 21 numerical pairs between 1 and 6 (e.g., 6 vs 5, 6 vs 4, 6 vs 3, etc.). The side of the larger option was pseudo randomized with no left or right runs longer than 3 in a row. The pairs were organized into blocks with one instance of each pair per block and pairs randomized within each block. Subjects order was randomized per session.  
   
# Data Analysis

All data were analyzed using the same pre-registered analyses. To test the first hypothesis, whether pinyon jays prefer larger over smaller numbers of food items and conspecifics, we conducted one sample t-tests. To test our second and third hypotheses, whether numerical difference and ratio predict preferences between smaller and larger options and whether these preferences were _independent_ of each other, we used generalized linear mixed-effects modeling.

We used trial-level choices for either the larger (coded as 1) or smaller (coded as 0) option available in the number pair as the response variable. To investigate our hypotheses, we used generalized logistic models to compare which combination of random (subject, pair, or both) and fixed (ratio, difference, or a combination of both) effects best describe each data set (food and social). We first found the best-fitting random effect structure, then added this random structure to all of the possible fixed effect structures, leaving us with the final best fitting model for each data set overall. 
We included models with no fixed effect and either (1) no random effects (intercept only), (2) subject as a random effect, (3) number pair as a random effect (to account for each bird repeatedly seeing each pair multiple times), and (4) both subject and number pair as random effects. For example, the model with both subject and pair as random effects ran using the `glmer()` function. We then used Bayes factors to select the model with the best-fitting random effect structure. We added the chosen random effect structure to our fixed effects to find the best-fitting model for the data set overall. The five fixed effects models were: (1) no fixed effects (intercept only), (2) ratio as a fixed effect, (3) difference as a fixed effect, (4) both difference and ratio as a fixed effects but _without_ an interaction, and (5) both difference and ratio as fixed effects _with_ an interaction. The model with both difference and ratio as fixed effects with an interaction term ran using the `glm()` function. We calculated Bayes factors using the `test_performance()` function from the _performance_ package [@Ludeckestrengejacke.etal.2021], which estimates Bayes factors from model BIC values using  Wagenmakers' [@Wagenmakers.2007] equation. The best fitting model has the highest Bayes factor. The second hypothesis will be supported if difference and ratio are both included as main effects in the best fitting model while the third hypothesis will be supported if the interaction is included. We draw inferences based on Bayesian statistics (_BF_ values) where a _BF_ > 3 is sufficient evidence for the alternative hypothesis, _BF_ < 1/3 is sufficient evidence for the null hypothesis, and 1/3 < _BF_ < 3 indicate neither hypothesis has evidence supporting it (suggesting the sample size is too small to draw conclusions).

# Results

## Food Experiment

Our first hypothesis predicted that subjects would choose the larger number of mealworms over the smaller number within any given pair. Results from a one sample t-test provided strong evidence that our hypothesis was supported in both phase 1 (`r apa_print(large_pref_ttest_food)$full_result`, `r apa_print(large_pref_ttest_bf_food)$statistic`) and phase 2 (`r apa_print(large_pref_ttest_food_rep)$full_result`, `r apa_print(large_pref_ttest_bf_food_rep)$statistic`). On average, our subjects in the first phase of the food study chose the larger option `r mean(birdsummary_food$perc)`% of the time +/- `r sd(birdsummary_food$perc)` and `r mean(birdsummary_food_rep$perc)`% of the time +/- `r sd(birdsummary_food_rep$perc)`in the second phase.
 
To investigate our other two hypotheses, we used model selection with mixed effect models. Hypothesis two predicts that (H2) pinyon jays prefer higher differences and lower ratios. If difference and ratio are both included as main effects in the best fitting model than hypothesis two will be supported. The data support the same best fitting model structure for both phases of data. The best-fitting random effect structure for the food item data was the intercept only model, or no random effect structure, by rule of parsimony. The inclusion of only subject as a random effect (Phase 1:`r printbf(nonsocial_random_comparison_table$BF[2])`, Phase 2: `r printbf(nonsocial_random_comparison_rep_table$BF[2])` ) was under 0.33, providing evidence that this random effect structure was not supported by the data. Therefore, we included no random effect structure in the second stage of comparisons looking at fixed effects. The five fixed effect model structures we compared included the (1) intercept only model against the model with (2) ratio as a fixed effect, (3) difference as a fixed effect, (4) both difference and ratio as a fixed effects but _without_ an interaction, and (5) both difference and ratio as fixed effects _with_ an interaction. The model with only the main effect of ratio (Phase 1: `r printbf(nonsocial_fixed_comparison_table$BF[2])`, Phase 2:`r printbf(nonsocial_fixed_comparison_rep_table$BF[2])`) best fit both data sets out of the five models that we compared. Thus, subjects in the food study used the ratio between the two numbers of mealworms to choose between options, with stronger preferences for larger options at smaller ratios (Figure \ref{fig:foodgraphs}. Consequently, this only partially supports our second hypothesis, since difference was not included in the best fitting model (Figure \ref{fig:foodgraphs}.  Additionally, our third hypothesis was not supported, as neither difference nor ratio were included in the best fitting model.

## Social Experiment
Hypothesis 1 predicted that subjects would choose the larger number of flock mates over the smaller. Results from a one sample t-test provided moderate evidence that our hypothesis was supported during the first phase(`r apa_print(large_pref_ttest_social)$full_result`, `r apa_print(large_pref_ttest_bf_social)$statistic`). However, it was not supported during the second phase (`r apa_print(large_pref_ttest_social_rep)$full_result`, `r apa_print(large_pref_ttest_bf_social_rep)$statistic`). During the first rep our subject choose the larger option `r mean(birdsummary_social$perc)`% of the time +/- `r sd(birdsummary_social$perc)` and `r mean(birdsummary_social_rep$perc)`% of the time +/- `r sd(birdsummary_social_rep$perc)` during the second phase. This is the only incongruency between phase 1 and 2 and can most likely be accounted for that the slight preference for the larger side is not a true preference for larger _amounts_ but that a preferred partner is more likely to appear in the larger group. This was accounted for in phase 2 with stronger randomization controls for stooge birds. 

Results progressed similarly for the social study, we tested all possible random effects (subject, pair, and both) against the intercept only model to determine which, if any, of these random effects should be used in the full model. The data again supported the same best fitting model structure for both phases of data. Model testing revealed that no random effect structure was the best fitting model for the flock mate study. The intercept only  model with a Bayes factor of (Phase 1: `r social_random_comparison_table$BF[1]`, Phase 2: `r social_random_comparison_rep_table_rep$BF[1]` ) is the chosen random effect structure by rule of parsimony as it is the least complex model, therefore no random effect structure was added to our fixed effect models for the social study. Similarly, when looking at fixed effects, the intercept only model (Phase 1: `r printbf(social_model_comparison_table$BF[2])`, Phase 2:`r printbf(social_model_comparison_rep_table$BF[2])`) best fit the data by rule of parsimony. Similarly, to the random effect model structures, our fixed effect models also had Bayes factors less than 1/3. Because ratio and difference failed to predict choices, neither of our hypothesis were supported by the data (Figure \ref{fig:socialgraphs}). Subjects did not use difference or ratio to make numerical decisions about conspecifics.

# Discussion

We examined pinyon jays' numerical cognitive abilities in a food and social preference task. Birds chose the larger of the two options on average in the food experiment but not in the social experiment partially confirming our first hypothesis. In the food study, smaller numerical ratios but not larger numerical differences predicted the birds’ choices partially confirming our second hypothesis. In the social experiment, neither ratio nor difference predicted choice showing that our second hypothesis was unsupported. In both the food and social experiments, difference and ratio did not independently predict choice indicating that our third hypothesis was also unsupported across studies. In neither context do pinyon jays use both ratio and difference together to choose between flock mates or food items

Results from the food study align with previous corvid research that birds prefer larger over smaller quantities and smaller ratios [@Ditz.Nieder.2016;@Kelly.2016;@Tornick.etal.2015]. This ratio effect supports our theory that preference for the larger option decreases as the ratio between the values approaches 1, confirming that birds acted in accordance with the _numerical magnitude effect_. Therefore, we have evidence supporting subjects using the approximate number system as a mechanism for quantity discrimination. Pinyon jays use amount of food, rather than precise number. However, the _numerical distance effect_ was not present in our data as number preference did not increase as difference increased between two values. See limitations for further comment on this outcome. 

Our lack of significant findings in the social study suggests that pinyon jays do not employ only one mechanism across contexts. While ratio was shown to be an important mechanism to pinyon jays when foraging, neither difference nor ratio were the mechanism of choice when choosing between flock mates. This outcome is surprising as previous numeric discrimination tasks with conspecifics found effects of difference and ratio [@Agrillo.Dadda.2007;@Agrillo.etal.2008]. However, these experiments were completed in fish, not corvids. Corvids have a more complex system of sociality [@Balda.Kamil.1998]. Possibly, individual identity of birds overrides the implicit need to go to the smaller ratio and larger difference. Work in geese indicate that movement patterns of individuals  may be shaped by the personality types present in the group [@Kurvers.etal.2009]. Furthermore, when testing Mexican Jay’s on food item discrimination in the presence of flock mates, [@Kelly.2016] found no significant effect of ratio or difference as the birds were more likely to follow the previous bird, than pick the food item of a larger quantity. Possibly, this is because observing conspecifics provides important information, such as the safety of a food patch or resource availability [@Krause.etal.2010; @Handegard.etal.2012]. Taken together, this suggests that birds do no view conspecifics in the same numeric terms as other objects and further investigation is needed to understand what internal systems animals are using to make numerical choices about conspecifics.

The differences in numerical preference between food and social contexts may be due to different selective pressures. Both flock size and foraging techniques have consequences for evolutionary fitness, but they tackle different adaptive problems. Food consumption acts primarily via natural selection by enhancing survival. Flock size, however, is integral to both natural and sexual selection: natural selection in the form of predator evasion, and sexual selection in the form of mate preference/reproduction. Joining a larger flock size allows an animal to dilute their chances of being eaten by predators (i.e., the dilution effect). Predator evasion acts on natural selection, allowing the animal to live long enough to reproduce, propagating its genes into the next generation. This selection pressure could account for our lack of difference and ratio findings in the flock mate experiment. Instead of using numerical difference and ratio to optimize predator evasion, birds are more likely focused on other biological imperatives like finding a suitable mate. Based on our current data, it seems that when choosing between two flocks, birds are making decision not based on the number of animals on each side but rather the identity of the animals. For example, a female bird should go to the flock option with suitable males, aligning with sexual selection mechanisms, over optimizing predator evasion. It is these evolutionary differences that could account for the variation we see in numerical cognitive strategies.

It is important to highlight that these results correspond to a numerical _preference_ task, not a discrimination task. If a subject discriminates between two objects, that means they recognize them as different. Preference denotes a liking of one option over the other. Meaning, the lack of a preference between two numbers of objects does not mean that the subject cannot discriminate the two objects. They just might not care about the difference. If a bird chooses indiscriminately between 5 or 6 mealworms it may not mean that they cannot discriminate between 5 and 6, but rather they are equally preferred. A clear preference implies discrimination, but lack of a preference does not imply an absence of discrimination. 

To be clear, we are not making any claims about the method by which the birds make these preference-based numerical choices. That is, our study does not allow us to distinguish between the birds choosing larger _numbers_ of food items or conspecifics and larger _amounts_ of them. Previous studies have shown that instead of the absolute number, animals often make decisions based on the surface area or item size available [@Gomez-Laplaza.Gerlai.2013;@Gomez-Laplaza.etal.2019]. For example, in our study, subjects could have chosen an option because they have a preference for 10% of a tray covered by mealworms over another with only 7% of the tray covered as opposed to preferring six over four mealworms. It is possible surface area, density, or quantity were all possible methods used by the subjects to make the numerical decisions discussed in the paper. In the food item study, total quantity is a reasonable criteria because the birds ultimate goal is to obtain as much food as possible to stay alive (e.g. two large mealworms are better than 3 small mealworms). Therefore, total calories or overall food intake, rather than absolute number, is a better evolutionary strategy. Future work is needed to tease apart which methods birds use when presented with food or conspecifics.

## Limitations

Though numerical ratio predicted choice in the food study, it did not in the social study, and difference did not predict choice in either study. This result was unlike previous corvid research, which found both difference and ratio effects in food studies [@Ditz.Nieder.2016;@Kelly.2016;@Tornick.etal.2015]. This could be due to the limited range within our pair options. The smallest difference option we offered subjects was one (2-1=1) and the largest was five (6-1=5). Previous studies difference options ranged from 8 as the largest option offered to 30 [@Ditz.Nieder.2016;@Tornick.etal.2015]. Considering that pinyon jay flock sizes range from 50 to 500 [@Wiggins.2005], the limited range of difference options may not have provided enough opportunities to demonstrate effects of difference. 

## Conclusion

The present research investigated how pinyon jays assess numbers of food items and conspecifics in a preference task. We showed that overall, pinyon jays only chose the larger over the smaller option in a food based task. In a food context, pinyon jays use numerical ratio but _not_ numerical difference to make decisions. In a social context, subjects did not use difference or ratio to make decisions. Our findings suggest that while number or amount is important for selecting food items, other factors such as flock mate identity may be more important for selecting social groups to join. Thus, in numerical preference situations, the type of objects offered drive the numerical strategies that animals use. Numerical Cognition research in non-human animals is lacking in non-food based tasks and should be further explored.
